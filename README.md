# Explorer
Explorer is an app that lets you stay updated on up to date information about various space missions. this file explains how each feature of the app works.

## 📄Pages
### 🏠Home
The home page is the landing page for the app. There are currently three different elements on the home page. The content is swipable, so you swipe the images to see others. Clicking on the image takes you to a website to learn more about.

The "news" section provides you with some important news updates. The "Featured Launches" shows the most important launches that are coming up. The "Featured Missions" shows the most important missions that are currently active. More missions will be added to that slide.

### 🚀Launches
This page displays the launch schedule from various space providers. As well as two government space agencies, NASA and Roscosmos. When you click on the navigation button, it will take you to a place where you can pick what space provider you want to view. They are in alphabetical order and clicking on one will take you to their launch schedule. If one is empty, it means that there are no confirmed launches at the moment.

### 🖥️Livestreams
This page has no content at the moment and is being worked on. Content for this page will be added hopefully by the end of the year.

The livestreams page will be where you can view coverage on different space missions. SpaceX will probably be empty since I'll be embedding Youtube videos and they no longer publish livestreams on Youtube. Clicking on it currently does nothing except for giving a message, but when it's done it will take you to a page where you can view what space agency you want to see coverage from.
