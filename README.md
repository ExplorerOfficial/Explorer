<br>
This tab is where every bit of app code will be published. To view some code, click on the file or folder. I'm making Explorer's code available for references or learning, please don't copy the code to make your own app, although this is mostly to improve your own learning experience. Some acceptable examples are just to see what the framework looks like or learning how a spacific component is created and implimented.

### Issues Tab

The Issues tab you won't have a reason to look at, I don't use this tab myself. Issues are like tasks that you can assign to a project within the repository. I create issues for the "Projects" page, I've never looked at this one.
 
### Discussions Tab

<br>
The Discussion Tab is a place where you can discuss anything related to the app. You can make a post within the coresponding category, then other people including me can reply to your post. This is also the main platform where I will be posting announcements about the app. Every post should be relavent to Explorer and be within the approporiate category. If not, I'll remove the post, or ask you to fix the issue. I'm trying to keep this discussion page organized, so everything is easy to find.

### Projects Tab

<br>
This tab is where you can see what is planned for the app, before requesting a new feature please check of it's already listed in one of the projects. The tab will let you know what stage or state Explorer is in or how it's doing.

### Wiki Tab

<br>
The Wiki tab is a wikipedia that will provide detailed documentation about Explorer. If you're confused about the app, this is a good resource here. I'm not allowing other people to edit or contribute, it will be a closed Wikipedia. But you can request to add or change something in the Wiki.
