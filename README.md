<h1>Explorer</h1>
<p>Welcome! This respository is where you can learn about Explorer, recieve updates, and take part in discussions.</p>

<h2>What you'll find here</h2>
<p>In the discussions page, you can start or take part in discussions if you'd like to actively participate in this app's development. The Wiki page contains detailed information about the app, anything that is readily available once it's completed.</p>

<h2>Discussions Guidelines</h2>
<p>Discussions is a way for you as the user to actively engage in the development of Explorer. Create or take part in conversations about Explorer.</p>
<p>There is no regulation for speech because I want to encourage everyone to speak freely. Although, you'll be limited to GitHub's guidelines which will be enforced by Github, not me.</p>
<ol>
  <li>No Spamming: Any messages I see as spam will be deleted. I would like to keep these discussions clean and easy to navigate between relavent topcs.</li>
  <li>Relavent Topics Only: This is only a place to discuss Explorer. I have created a category where you can talk about whatever you want. Off topic conversations should go in that category. This is only to keep the discussions clean and help make it easy to find relavent content.</li>
  <li>No promotions: This is a place to discuss Explorer, not promote your apps, website, books, whatever your projects are. However, I will allow them to be mentioned if it connects to the conversation that is about Explorer. If you want to talk about your personal projects with the community, you can gladly do so in the off topic category.</li>
</ol>

<p>Not trying to regulate how you communicate, I created an off topic category to allow you to communicate however you want. These regulations are just set to help keep the discussions clean and help people find what they need.</p>
